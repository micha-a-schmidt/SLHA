# SLHA
SLHA reader/writer for Julia

SLHA files can be read via **readSLHA(<filename>)** which returns a Julia data structure with all SLHA entries.
The SLHA data structure can be written to file via **writeSLHA(<filename>)**. The functions automatically handle lists, matrices, ... . A detailed description of the Julia data structure can be found at the start of SLHA.jl and (hopefully) soon here.
